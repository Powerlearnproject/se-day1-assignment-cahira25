#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineeering principles, methods adn tools to the development and maintenance of high qualtity software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.
Software engineering enables the cration of applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life. These include: Entertaiment, Healthcare, Commerce and Communication.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages such as Fortran and C.
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
Advent of structured programmig in the 1970s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements phase: involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design phase: involves creating high level and detailed designs of the software and architecture and user interface.
Implementation phase: involves writing code and building the software according to the specifications of the design.
Testing phase: involves conduction of various tests to ensure the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment phase: involves releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance phase: involves provision of ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology involves sequential approach with distinct phases(eg requirements, design, implementation) which flow downwards like a waterfall. An example of a scenario where this methodology would be appropriate is building a bridge. Phases undertaken when building a bridge must be followed in a specific order.
Agile methodology involves an ierative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and response to change. An example of a scenario involving agile methodology is developing of a mobile app.The user needs and technology used need to be able to quickly evolve, which requires flexibility and adaptability.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assuarance Engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager: oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is a software that provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing eg visual studio code.
Version Control Systems (VCS): are software tools used for trcking change to source code and co-ordinatind work among team members eg git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges include:effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Promp engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
It helps in making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.





Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
'Tell me about kpop,' the AI might give a general answer. 
But if you ask, 'Tell me about the history of kpop,' you'll get a more focused response rather than a general one.
